# Phishing

Investigating a PHISHING email and steps taken to protect the organization<br>

The reporting section generally at the end of the Incident Report will mention the defensive actions taken, or that you are requesting be taken in order to protect the organization.<br><Br> 
Defensive measures refer to activities after a phishing attack in order to prevent attacks using the same artifacts observed in the analyzed email.

We can perform three main types of actions

***Email artifact blocking*** (subject line, sending address, sending server IP) <br>
***Web artifact blocking*** (URL, domain, IP)<br>
***File artifact blocking*** (file name, file hash) <br>

  -------------------
  Depending on the organization, it is likely there will be one of two paths to complete these actions:

Analysts are able to directly conduct defensive measures themselves.
Analysts must request defensive measures to be taken by senior analysts or other departments and need to provide sufficient justification.
